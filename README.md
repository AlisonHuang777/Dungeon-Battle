A game that takes inspiration from **Soul Knight**. Was made for a high school project.

To run the game, make sure that *Dungeon Battle.py* and *dgbt_data* is in the same directory. *pygame* library is also required.

WASD to move around, mouse cursor to aim, LMB to shoot. You have a health bar (red) and a shield bar (gray). Shield, which automatically regenrates when not taking damage for a while, is reduced first when you receive damage. Health will only be reduced if the shield has depleted. Losing all health result in death (gameover), which will restart the game (score, foe strength, and stat boosts are reset).

Score is obtained for each foe defeated/chest looted/level cleared. Chests also give random stat boosts. There are infinite amount of levels, and foes get stonger for each level cleared.

To close the game, press Esc key. The number at the top-right is your framerate (max 60).
